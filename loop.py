'''LOOPS
There are two type of loops in python 
1.while loop
2.for loop
'''
#while loop
# i=1
# while i<=50:
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1
'''WAP to print the content of list using while loop'''
#lst=["harshit",43,[1,4,"shreya"],{54,62,64,74},("how","would","could")]
#print(lst)
# i=0
# while i<=4:
#     print(lst[i])
#     i=i+1

#for loop
'''Program to find the sum of all numbers stored in a list'''
# num=[7,9,0,4,6,3]
# sum=0
# for val in num:
#     sum=sum+val

# print("The sum is", sum)

'''WAP to print the content of list using for loop'''
# lst=["harshit",43,[1,4,"shreya"],{54,62,64,74},("how","would","could")]

# for item in lst:
#     print(item)

'''range function/for with else/step-size'''
# for i in range(3,61,3):
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print("this is inside else of for")
